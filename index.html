                    <h2>Lionel messi</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 33 goals, 14 assists. Won Copa America & Copa del Rey.

                        It was the moment millions of football fans have been waiting the best part of 15 years for, as Messi finally got his hands on a major international trophy.</p>

                    <h2>Robert Lewandowski</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 34 goals, four assists. Won Bundesliga & Club World Cup.

                        Undoubtedly the player who enjoyed the best individual season in Europe's top leagues, the Golden Shoe winner.</p>

                    <h2>Jorginho</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: Five goals, two assists. Won Euro 2020 & Champions League.

                        Was Jorginho the best player in Chelsea's run to winning the Champions League? No.
                        
                        Was Jorginho the best player in Italy's run to winning Euro 2020? Also no.</p>

                    <h2>N'Golo Kante</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: One assist. Won Champions League.

                        Kante's Man-of-the-Match-winning displays in the latter stages of the Champions League might be enough to secure him a place in the top three, but right now it feels as if the Chelsea man is on the outside looking in at the Ballon d'Or podium.</p>

                    <img src="images/players/luka.jpg" alt="">
                    <h2>Romelu Lukaku</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 22 goals, seven assists. Won Serie A.

                        Lukaku does have a realistic shot at the Ballon d'Or podium, particularly if he can lead Belgium to glory at the Nations League finals in October, but the ultimate individual award now seems beyond the Inter striker for another year.</p>

                    <img src="images/players/mbappe-1.jpg" alt="">
                    <h2>Kylian Mbappe</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 29 goals, seven assists. Won Coupe de France & Trophee des Champions.

                        Mbappe may be the cover star of FIFA 22, but a place on the Ballon d'Or podium is now highly unlikely for the PSG forward after a year of memorable Champions League performances but no major trophies.</p>

                    <h2>Kevin De Bruyne</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 10 goals, 10 assists. Won Premier League & Carabao Cup.

                        Aside from the PFA Player of the Year prize, there will be no individual awards for De Bruyne this year, despite continuing to confirm himself as the best creative midfielder on the planet.</p>

                    <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 27 goals, four assists. Won Coppa Italia & Supercoppa Italiana.

                        Ronaldo may have secured himself the Euro 2020 Golden Boot as he edged out Patrik Schick thanks to a solitary assist, but that will not ease the pain of Portugal's early exit.</p>

                    <img src="images/players/haland.jpg" alt="">
                    <h2>Erling Haaland</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 25 goals, nine assists. Won DFB-Pokal.

                        There is a chance that Haaland's performances over the early part of 2021 are lost in the weeds of Euro 2020 and the Copa America, but if the Norway star begins the new campaign in red-hot form.</p>

                    <h2>Federico Chiesa</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 14 goals, five assists. Won Euro 2020, Coppa Italia & Supercoppa Italiana.

                        Watching Chiesa play in both the semi-final and final of Euro 2020, it is scarcely believable that Roberto Mancini left him out of the Italy team for the Azzurri's first two group games.</p>

                    <h2>Karim Benzema</h2>
                    <p>In 2021: 22 goals, five assists.

                        Though he has ended the season without a trophy, Benzema still led Real Madrid to the semi-finals of the Champions League and scored four goals in as many games at Euro 2020.</p>

                    <p>In 2021: 11 goals, seven assists. Won Premier League & Carabao Cup.

                        Likely would have been the Player of the Tournament at Euro 2020 had England triumphed in the final, Sterling instead had to settle for a runners-up medal after having been well marshalled during the final.</p>
